# Hollow-Knight-Items-Only-Poptracker-Pack
This is for tracking items only in Hollow Knight randomizer using poptracker with auto-tracking when using Archipelago.

## Requirements
Poptracker Client (https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases)

Place the file under the packs folder in your poptracker folder.

This is only intended for showing received items and does not include any logic or maps. I don't intend on adding these at any point.
I may look into a way of detecting if your using split items or not and only showing those but that might be beyond my current knowldge level.
